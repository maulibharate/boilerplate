# A Full MERN Stack Boilerplate for Web Apps.

## Techonologies

* MongoDb and Mongoose - MongoDb as a Database and mongoose as as a Object Data - Modeling library for MongoDB and Node.js.
* Express - as a backend Framework.
* React - as a Frontend Framework.
* Node - as a Server.
* Redux - for state Management (will be updated).
* JsonWebToken - for creating JSON-based access tokens.
* bcryptjs - for hashing the user passwords.




## Features

### Frontend
* Formik - It helps with the three most annoying parts: Getting values in and out of form state. Validation and error messages. Handling form submission.
* Yup - JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
* React Router - used for developing Single Page Web Applications.
* Hooks - extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused.
* Reducer - determines a change to an application's state.
* async await - async function to stop executing until the promise is resolved (For API calling).
* reactstrap - defined in React-friendly components with appropriate props for you to control.
* CSS and bootstrap - for styling.
* dotenv - allows you to separate secrets from your source code (environment variables).
* .gitignore - git which files (or patterns) it should ignore.

### Backend
* JsonWebToken - for creating JSON-based authentication access tokens.
* bcryptjs - for hashing the user passwords.
* Mongoose Schema - allow you to perform validation on the fields you expect or are required.
* async await - async function to stop executing until the promise is resolved (For API calling).
* dotenv - allows you to separate secrets from your source code (environment variables).
* .gitignore - git which files (or patterns) it should ignore.


## Quick Start

#### To use this application,

#### Inside the server directory

```bash
npm install
```  
```bash
npm start
```

#### Inside the client directory

```bash
npm install
```  
```bash
npm start
```



## Future Features

### Frontend
* Redux - for state Management (will be updated).
* SASS or LESS - make CSS more maintainable, themeable, and extendable.
* i18next - which uses components to render or re-render the translated content of your application
* ESLint - for identifying and reporting on patterns found in JavaScript code.
* axiox - used to make HTTP requests from node. js or XMLHttpRequests.
* tooltip - for show Error and message
* React Native - to create slick, smooth and responsive user interface
* websocket - provide persistent real-time communication between the client and the server over a single TCP socket connection.
#### New Features - coming soon...
