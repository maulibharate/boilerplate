# A Full MERN Stack Boilerplate for Web Apps.

## Techonologies

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) - MongoDb as a Database and mongoose as as a Object Data - Modeling library for MongoDB and Node.js.
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - as a backend Framework.
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - as a Frontend Framework.
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) - as a Server.
* [JsonWebToken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) - for creating JSON-based access tokens.
* [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) - for hashing the user passwords.




## Features

### Frontend
* [Formik](https://formik.org/) - It helps with the three most annoying parts: Getting values in and out of form state. Validation and error messages. Handling form submission.
* [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) - JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - used for developing Single Page Web Applications.
* [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) - extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused.
* [Reducer](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers) - determines a change to an application's state.
* [async await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) - async function to stop executing until the promise is resolved (For API calling).
* [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/story/home-installation--page) - defined in React-friendly components with appropriate props for you to control.
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) and [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - for styling.
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - allows you to separate secrets from your source code (environment variables).
* [.gitignore](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore) - git which files (or patterns) it should ignore.

### Backend
* [JsonWebToken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) - for creating JSON-based authentication access tokens.
* [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) - for hashing the user passwords.
* [Mongoose Schema](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) - allow you to perform validation on the fields you expect or are required.
* [async await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) - async function to stop executing until the promise is resolved (For API calling).
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - allows you to separate secrets from your source code (environment variables).
* [.gitignore](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore) - git which files (or patterns) it should ignore.


## Quick Start

#### To use this application,

#### Inside the server directory

```bash
npm install
```  
```bash
npm start
```

#### Inside the client directory

```bash
npm install
```  
```bash
npm start
```



## Future Features

### Frontend
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - for state Management (will be updated).
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) or [LESS](https://lesscss.org/) - make CSS more maintainable, themeable, and extendable.
* [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) - which uses components to render or re-render the translated content of your application
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - for identifying and reporting on patterns found in JavaScript code.
* [axiox](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - used to make HTTP requests from node. js or XMLHttpRequests.
* [tooltip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc-tooltip) - for show Error and message
* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) - to create slick, smooth and responsive user interface
* [websocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) - provide persistent real-time communication between the client and the server over a single TCP socket connection.
#### New Features - coming soon...
