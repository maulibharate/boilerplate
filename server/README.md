* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - as a backend Framework.
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) - as a Server.
* [JsonWebToken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) - for creating JSON-based access tokens.
* [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) - for hashing the user passwords.

## Features

* [JsonWebToken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) - for creating JSON-based authentication access tokens.
* [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) - for hashing the user passwords.
* [Mongoose Schema](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) - allow you to perform validation on the fields you expect or are required.
* [async await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) - async function to stop executing until the promise is resolved (For API calling).
